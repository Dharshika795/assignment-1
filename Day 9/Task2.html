    <h1>Margin values and compare spacing</h1>
    <div class="a1">
        <p>In this example, two boxes are created with different margin values.The first box has a small margin, while the second box has a large margin.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="a2">
        <p>We can clearly see that as the margin value increases, the spacing around the box also increases.This helps us understand how the margin property controls the space outside an element.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="a3">
       <p> This experiment shows how margins help in adjusting layout and element positioning on a webpage.As the margin value increases, the distance between the element and nearby content becomes wider.</p>
