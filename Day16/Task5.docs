<JavaScript (JS) has evolved greatly since its creation:
1. **1995 – Birth of JavaScript:**
   Brendan Eich created JavaScript at Netscape in just 10 days to make web pages interactive. It was first called *Mocha*, then *LiveScript*, and finally *JavaScript*.

2. **1996 – Microsoft Introduces JScript:**
   Microsoft released its own version of JavaScript called **JScript** for Internet Explorer, leading to early browser incompatibilities.

3. **1997 – ECMAScript Standardization:**
   JavaScript became standardized by **ECMA International** as **ECMAScript (ES1)** to ensure compatibility across browsers.

4. **1999 – ECMAScript 3 (ES3):**
   Major improvements were added like regular expressions, better string handling, and exception handling with `try...catch`.

5. **2005 – AJAX Revolution:**
   **AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)** allowed web pages to load data dynamically without refreshing — used in Gmail, Google Maps, etc.

6. **2006 – Rise of Frameworks:**
   Libraries like **jQuery**, **Prototype**, and **MooTools** simplified DOM manipulation and cross-browser coding.

7. **2009 – ES5 Update:**
   **ES5** added `strict mode`, JSON support, and array methods like `forEach`, `map`, and `filter`. It made JavaScript more reliable and easier to maintain.

8. **2009 – Node.js Launch:**
   **Node.js** allowed JavaScript to run outside browsers — on servers — enabling **full-stack development** with one language.

9. **2010 – Rise of Single-Page Apps (SPA):**
   Frameworks like **AngularJS** and **Backbone.js** enabled dynamic, app-like web pages without full reloads.

10. **2013 – Modern Frameworks Appear:**
    **React (by Facebook)** and **Vue.js** transformed front-end development with component-based architecture.

11. **2015 – ES6 (ECMAScript 2015):**
    A massive update introduced `let`, `const`, arrow functions, classes, promises, template literals, and modules — marking the era of **modern JavaScript**.

12. **2016–2018 – Yearly ES Updates:**
    New features like `async/await`, the spread operator (`...`), and object destructuring were added, improving readability and async handling.

13. **2019–2021 – TypeScript & Modern Tools:**
    **TypeScript** (typed JS), along with bundlers like **Webpack**, **Vite**, and **Parcel**, made large-scale JS apps more reliable and efficient.

14. **2022–2024 – Performance & Simplicity:**
    Added new features like `top-level await`, private class fields, and `Array.prototype.at()`. New runtimes like **Deno** and **Bun** made JS faster and safer.

15. **2025 – JavaScript Everywhere:**
    Today, JS runs **on browsers, servers, mobile apps, IoT devices, and AI tools**. It remains one of the world’s most powerful and universal programming languages — truly the language of the web and beyond.
