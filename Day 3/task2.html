            <p>The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nations – Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Oman – are overall embracing AI full-on. 
            First, the UAE’s AI Strategy 2031, launched in 2017, which saw it also include the world’s first AI Minister, now spans across education, health, 
            governance, and energy transformation; a visible sign of implementation can be seen with plans for Abu Dhabi to have one of the world’s largest AI data centres.</p>

            <p>The rest, beyond just the Arabian Gulf, are using AI to address their own challenges and foster opportunities as well, through alignment of their own national transformation programs coupled with necessity. These include:</p>
               <ul>
                    <li><p>Egypt, which launched its own AI strategy just in January this year, aims to see it advance sectors such as healthcare and fintech, with the latter helping bring further financial inclusion to both individuals and businesses</p></li>
                    <li><p>Jordan launched its five-year AI strategy with 68 targeted projects aimed at enhancing Jordan’s AI capabilities across multiple sectors, such as healthcare and logistics</p></li>
